# Master rules
- Rules refer to how a piece currently moves/takes/acts, given the application of previous rules. "Orthodox piece" refers the original piece.
- The "+" indicates extra cards to be drawn. (Optional) Only the first "+" card seen draws additional cards.
- Any piece "moving as a pawn", may be taken en passant.
